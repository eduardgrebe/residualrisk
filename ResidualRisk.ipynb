    "This notebook provides a Python implementation of the Weusten et al. (2011) model for residual risk of HIV transfusion transmission with NAT screening.\n",

    "This code implements a mathematical model for deriving \"risk day equivalents\" (i.e. infectious window period), in the case of nucleic acid screening of blood donations for viruses like HIV, for the purposes of estimating residual risk of transfusion transmission. In this implementation, we assume that the user will have an estimate of incidence in the donor population, which when multiplied by the \"risk day equivalents\" estimate will yield the risk that any given donation will transmit the virus.\n",
